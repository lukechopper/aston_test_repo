  The Amazing Hare


  A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the
Tortoise, who replied, laughing:  "Though you be swift as the
wind, I will beat you in a race."  The Hare, believing her
assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and
they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the
goal.  On the day appointed for the race the two started
together.  The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, an approach 
that would have almost won him the race if it wasn't for the
Hare who, after spending most of the race fast asleep on the wayside,
finally waking up and, seeing that the Tortoise had almost reached the end goal,
moving as fast as he could, overtaking the Tortoise right 
at the last second, winning the race. Well! Interesting end to the story.


    Slow but steady does not win the race, blind luck does instead.
But is it Right?? The Author asked himself
